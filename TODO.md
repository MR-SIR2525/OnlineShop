#### BBNLT Development 
# TODO List

## High Priority
- Allow users edit their account
- Better database (MySQL or PostgreSQL?)


## Medium Priority
- Visual:
  - BBNLT logo
  - brand color scheme
  - turn home page into a page of pictures only, no prices, similar to Amazon's home page.
    - create new "Shop by Category" page. Refer to old BBNLT home page.
      - then the filter by category will come into play...
- Payment processing (Stripe)


## Low Priority
- Add BBNLT products 
- Inventory function
- Backend orders view for staff
